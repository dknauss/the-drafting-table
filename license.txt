BUNDLED ASSETS — IMAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No bundled images are included in this theme. The templates and patterns do
not reference any theme-bundled imagery. Users are expected to add their own
images through the WordPress block editor (Site Editor > Templates).

The theme's visual design is intentionally typographic and structural, and
works well with or without photography. Where images are used in patterns
or templates, block editor placeholders are provided.
